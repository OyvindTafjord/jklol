Renamings:
- Rename parametric factors to "families"
- Rename SufficientStatistics to something like "parametervector"
  - eliminate the list of tensors in this class.

Fixes:
- fix whatever test cases are broken.
- fix the expectation maximization algorithms
  - use EmOracle for stepwise em and incremental em
  - wtf is abstract trainer for?

Refactoring:
- clean up ExpressionTree generation (fromExpression)
- typing in ExpressionTree
- clean up grammar generation in CCG parser. Lots of too verbose code.
- Decouple Expression from CcgParser
  - Introduce a new interface for logical forms: Lf.
    Only needs to support apply, maybe a descriptive toString() function, implement serializable
  - Introduce a new interface for evaluating / comparing Lf instances.
    Methods: intensionallyEquals(), evaluate()?
  - Is casting the right way to go back from Lfs to the base type in a program?
    Generics (for basically every class in CcgParser) seem way overkill,
    and also mess up serialization.

Dependencies:
- get rid of GWT / Jackson
- Add BLAS for faster math
