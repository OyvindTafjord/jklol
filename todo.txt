Renamings:
- Rename parametric factors to "families"
- Rename SufficientStatistics to something like "parametervector"
  - eliminate the list of tensors in this class.

Fixes:
- test case for CFG parser
- test case for indicatorloglinearfactor
- fix the expectation maximization algorithms
  - use EmOracle for stepwise em and incremental em
  - wtf is abstract trainer for?

Refactoring:
- clean up grammar generation in CCG parser. Lots of too verbose code.

Dependencies:
- get rid of GWT / Jackson
- Add BLAS for faster math
