- Change to allow non-categorical variable types (or combinatorially large types, like parse trees)
- Nonparameteric Bayesian stuff (Dirichlet processes)
  - Gibbs sampling
  - Variational inference


Thoughts:
Does adding more complex variable types make it easier to handle the nonparametrics? 
I think so. We can represent the draw from the dirichlet process as a single variable, then
resample it appropriately?
