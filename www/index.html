<p>
<b>jklol</b> is a Java library for developing structured machine
learning models. jklol supports linear classification, structured
prediction, graphical models, likelihood-based and max-margin methods,
semi-supervised and weakly-supervised learning, generalized matrix /
tensor factorization, and neural networks. It is designed to be
intuitive, fast, and modular, with the main goal of reducing
development time for new machine learning models.
</p>

<h2>Why use jklol ...</h2>

<p>
... <em>at all?</em> <b>Because it will save you time.</b> Avoid
reimplementing basic algorithmic building blocks. (How many times have
you implemented gradient descent?)
</p>

<p>
... <em>as opposed to something else?</em> <b>Because it is more
flexible.</b> When developing a machine learning model, especially for
research purposes, you need the ability to change your system in
various ways. Maybe you want to use unlabeled data, or try out
max-margin learning, or add a weird constraint to your
objective. jklol's modular design allows you to independently swap out
inference algorithms, model structures, parametrizations, objectives
and optimization routines, making it easy to tinker.
</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

jklol supports:
<ul>
<li>Training and inference for general graphical models. Both
loglinear and max-margin training are supported, as are graphical
models with repeated structure (e.g., sequence models).</li>
<li>Semi-supervised and weakly-supervised training, using expectation
maximization or stochastic gradient.</li>
<li>Other structured prediction. (e.g., parsing)</li>
<li>A tensor library for fast mathematical computation.</li>
<li>Fast optimization via (stochastic) gradient descent or L-BFGS. All
optimization algorithms exploit parallelization for reduced training
times.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Sample Applications</h2>

<p>
I've used jklol for:

<ul>
<li>Part-of-speech tagging and CCG supertagging</li>
<li>Broad coverage CCG parsing and semantic parsing</li>
<li>Training models of vector space composition</li>
<li>Miscellaneous miniature graphical models</li>
<li>Matrix factorization ala universal schema</li>
</ul>

(Basically, <a href="http://www.jayantkrish.com/">the experiments for
anything I've published in the past 2 years</a> use jklol.)
